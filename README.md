## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a History and English teacher transitioning to a Tech career.

I'm currently learning about programming logic, with a bit of JavaScript and HTML.
Everything is pretty new to me, so any feedback is appreciated.

I have a few personal projects, which were created to support some teaching challenges.

My biggest interest is using and developing AI. That's something I want to pursue once I get the basis of programming.
